# Flipkart Customer Support Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Flipkart's customer support dataset (85,907 entries) to extract business insights regarding order trends, category-specific issues, agent performance, and customer satisfaction. Using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques, we identify key factors affecting customer experience and provide data-driven recommendations to enhance service efficiency.
